This is a simple game with arduino mega and TV Out library.

First download the Avamander TVout library from your favorite IDE, the classic Arduino 1.6/1.8, Arduino 2.0 or, and this is what I usually use, the "Visual Micro" for Visual Studio.

This is the GitHub link to download the library.

Remember that inside the TVout folder in Arduino Libraries, on your disk, you have to bring out the TVoutfonts folder. Look for this folder inside TVout and read the file "README.md"

Download the TimerThree library that will be used for the sound effects here's the GitHub link.
